271,1,I used to imagine I'd hear something at the door. I'd hear a knock and I'd pray it was her. Or I would hope it was her. I had dreams like that. I'm not having dreams like that now. I know she's gone. She won't be back. Ever. I sure love her. I sure miss her.
272,1,"Anyway, I walk around the house, and I try not to look at things, try not to think of her. But that's all I can do. All I do is feel this deep pain, this deep longing. I see her again. I remember when I was in Germany, and she left. "
273,1,"That she feels good, feels no pain, is happy. If there isn't, I'll probably never see her again. Unless there's some other side, like hell. How she may get to that side, I don't know how that would be. She was too much of a saint. "
274,1,"Came up here, a new life, after the last divorce and a year of being in pain. Slowly dissipated, but it's never gone. I've been abandoned again. Lost. Taken away from happiness. But I sure hope Debbie, if there is another world, a heaven, that she's in it. "

278,1,"And I walk around the house and sometimes I think just momentarily that she'll be back to take care of this or that. And I realize she'll never be back. She didn't go away on a trip. She didn't go away on vacation, she's not at work. She didn't go to the store. "
279,1,Manic depression has taken by soul I wish I could all this pain away
280,1,"Having a double mastectomy, very painful. Having radiation, never being over the pain. Taking pain killers, a lot of pain. And being diagnosed with Stage-4 cancer a year later, November 21st, 2017 to November 21st, 2018. And she died two months later, Jan 21st, 2019. "
281,1,"I walk around the house and I see things of Debbie and I think of her. I think of the pain she went through, suffered for so long. All those procedures she went through. Between finding out she had cancer and the pain. Having chemotherapy for a long time. "
282,1,"She would have some understanding. But noone, noone is there. People have their own lives and their own busy schedules. I have nothing but time. Time to think about what I used to have and what I no longer do have. I think, if I could only be with her again. "
283,1,"No matter how hard I try, I cannot force her memories from my mind. As much I loved and love her, I don't want to think about how much I miss her. She was the person I need the most when I feel this way. She would talk to me, she would spend time with me. "
